### Introduction
![[Boolean Algebra Introduction.png]]
Welcome to **Unit 3- Boolean Algebra and Logic Gates!** In this unit, you will explore the fascinating world of Boolean algebra and logic gates. These principles are essential for understanding how information is processed and manipulated in digital circuits. 

You will explore the fundamental laws such as **Commutative law**, **Associative law**, **Distributive law**, **AND law**, **OR law**, and **INVERSION law**. Understanding these laws is crucial for simplifying complex Boolean expressions. You will learn about De Morgan's theorems, which provide powerful tools for manipulating complex Boolean expressions. These theorems play a key role in solving logical problems and simplifying Boolean equations.

You will be introduced to different logic gates, including **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, **NAND**, and **NOR** **gates**. Understanding their representations and constructing truth tables for these gates will be a fundamental skill in this unit. You will also explore methods to determine the equivalence of Boolean expressions. This involves both algebraic manipulation and the use of truth tables to establish the equality of different logical expressions.
