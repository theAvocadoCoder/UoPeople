Part 1

Without an operating system (OS), it is virtually impossible for a user to interface with a computer system (Williams, 2023). This is because modern computers are very complex, and require intricate knowledge to manage all moving parts. The OS abstracts all this away, allowing the user to focus on the main tasks, rather than operational overhead.

The OS manages the processes or tasks, including creation, deletion, synchronization and communication (Williams, 2023). Mission critical processes on the e-commerce platform could be fetching and displaying the inventory data, computing the user's cart, etc.

When a program is run, it utilizes a portion of memory; the OS handles allocation and de-allocation of memory for this purpose (Gupta & Goyal, 2020; Williams, 2023). Without the OS to properly allocate and de-allocate memory, a program may be loaded into memory when space is not available. This could potentially overwrite any program already in memory. On the e-commerce platform, this could spell disaster if a user navigates to a product page while their payment is being processed. If the former overwrites the latter, it may create a complex financial situation.

The OS also manages the computer's file system, including organizing, storing, sharing, retrieving, naming, and protecting files (Williams, 2023). One of the most crucial features of an e-commerce platform is inventory management. The OS allows efficient interfacing with the inventory, as well as user data, such as profile, cart, payment details, and so on.

There are many devices (peripherals) a computer must keep track of. It does this with the help of the OS module known as the I/O controller (Williams, 2023). The e-commerce platform, as accessed by the user, will need a display device and an input device for recording user data. The OS handles these and ensures a smooth user experience.
  
Part 2

Each type of OS presents with its own strengths and trade-offs. According to VMware (n.d., para 1-2), fault tolerance refers to an OS's ability to respond to and allow for software or hardware malfunctions and failures.

The multiprogramming OS is the most popular type of OS for the average computer user. It is also known as multi-tasking or time-sharing OS due to how it utilizes time slices to rapidly switch between tasks, ensuring no job gets blocked. This effective time management allows for increased throughput (Learn with harshit, 2022a), making it ideal for handling the increased workload.

However, its reliance on a scheduling algorithm, dynamically parted memory and memory-swapping may hinder scalability. Also, it has no inherent fault tolerant measures in place.

In the multiprocessor OS, one program gets processed by multiple processors sharing a common memory (Gupta & Goyal, 2020). Specifically, distributed OS may be considered a type of loosely coupled multiprocessor OS (Gupta & Goyal, 2020; Learn with harshit, 2022b). This ensures faster processing due to load balancing (Learn with harshit, 2022b), making it fault tolerant. It is designed for speed and efficiency which makes it able to handle the work load. However, there may be constraints with scalability because it is not always possible to know where a program is running.
  
Part 3

Mobile OSs are designed specifically to allow handheld devices to run applications and programs (Smith, 2022; Williams, 2023). In the 21st century, smartphones are the most widely used handheld devices. For many, they are an essential tool for human living.

The mobile OSs that run on these devices possess layered architecture; this approach is used to manage hardware and software interactions. This allows for a significant degree of abstraction that makes these devices easy to use, making them a first choice for the average person.

The input systems for Mobile OSs are designed primarily for touch interaction; another factor that makes mobile devices easy to use. This pleasant user experience means most people are likely to use a software product on their mobile devices.

Mobile OSs employ robust security models to protect user data and system integrity, mitigating various attack vectors (Neso Academy, 2025). Specifically, sandboxing ensures the isolation of each running program, reducing the risk of third-party interference. 

Other security measures deployed by mobile OSs include biometric authentication, data encryption, permission based system access control, and so on. These provide an extra layer of security for business data.

Mobile OSs are also designed to operate under resource constraints, while leveraging sophisticated systems to optimize battery consumption. This often means that devices using mobile OSs are more affordable. Thus, the target audience for the business is much larger when making software for these devices.
