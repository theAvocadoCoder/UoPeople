In this assignment, you will be able to examine, identify, and apply the basic concepts of number systems.

**Scenario:** Envision yourself working at a technology company specializing in software development for various industries. One day, your supervisor hands you a task to convert a set of decimal numbers into their binary, octal, and hexadecimal equivalents for a project that involves encoding and decoding data. The numbers are critical for a system that communicates with different devices using specific coding representations.

1. Explain the process you would follow to convert the given decimal numbers to binary, octal, and hexadecimal representations. Take the first three digits of your birthdate as a single number (e.g., if your birthdate is 28-11-1982, use 281). Convert this number into binary, octal, and hexadecimal formats. Present your conversion process step-by-step, with an explanation for each step. Make sure you take your birthdate as a number, not 281.  
      
    
2. Why is it important to be proficient in converting between different number systems in a technical industry job? Provide at least two practical use cases or job functions where this skill is essential.
  
3. In your role on this project, you are also tasked with selecting a suitable coding representation (e.g., ASCII, Unicode, Gray code, BCD, EBCDIC) for communicating data between systems. Compare at least three of these representations based on character set size, compatibility, typical applications, and efficiency. Which coding representation would you recommend for this particular task and why?
  
4. Provide an example of a situation where choosing the right coding representation could be crucial for the success of a project. Explain the outcome if the wrong choice had been made.
