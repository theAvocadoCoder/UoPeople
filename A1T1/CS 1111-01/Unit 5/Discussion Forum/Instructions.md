The primary goal of this discussion assignment is to deepen your understanding of the core components and concepts related to Database Management Systems (DBMS). Through this assignment, you will critically analyze the advantages and disadvantages of databases, delve into the structure of databases, and explore key concepts such as data abstraction and data independence. 

**You are working as a consultant for a medium-sized business that is considering implementing a Database Management System (DBMS) to streamline its operations. The company is currently managing data through traditional file systems, and they are interested in understanding the benefits and challenges associated with transitioning to a database-driven approach. As a part of your role, you need to facilitate a discussion among key stakeholders to explore the core components and applications of databases, along with key concepts like data abstraction and data independence. Your discussion should focus on the following:**  

1. What are the core components of a database, and how do you think they differ from traditional file systems? Provide examples of applications where a database management system would be beneficial for the company's operations.  
  
2. Explore the different types of database management systems and discuss how each type can be suitable or unsuitable for the company's specific needs. 
  
3. How might data abstraction contribute to a more efficient and user-friendly interaction with the database for different stakeholders within the company? Provide examples of situations where achieving data independence is particularly crucial for the business.
