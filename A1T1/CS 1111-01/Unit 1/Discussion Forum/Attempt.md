Classifications and Characteristics

Learn Computer Science (2024, 0:43) describes a computer as "an electronic device that consists of hardware and software components"

Hardware are all the physical components of the computer which a user can touch, whereas software is the program, visible and intangible, which instructs the computer on how to process data and generate output (Gupta et al., 2020).

A computer block diagram illustrates the system as having four functional units. The input unit receives data from the user. The central processing unit (CPU) performs various arithmetic, logic, and system control tasks. The memory unit stores data to be retrieved by the CPU. The output unit presents processed data to the user (Learn Computer Science, 2024; Gupta et al., 2020).

Gupta et al. (2020) classifies computers upon a number of bases, viz. purpose, technology, size/capacity, and generation. The first explores whether the system serves a general or specialized purpose.

Technology refers to the signals processed by the system: analog, as in measurable physical phenomena; digital, as in ones and zeros; or a hybrid of the two.

The size of memory and capacity of storage can range from stand-alone systems using a single microprocessor chip, to minicomputers, to mainframes, to supercomputers, which are powerful machines based on the principle of parallel processing.

The generation a computer belongs to may be one of the earlier generations which used thermionic valves or transistor technology, the revolutionary third generation which introduced the integrated circuit chip, or the one of the recent generations utilizing large-scale-, very-large-scale-, or ultra-large-scale-integration to reduce computer size and enhance processing capabilities.

Factors for Choosing Computer Systems

Gupta et al. (2020, pp.35-36) defines software as "the program that instructs a computer how to process data and generate required output" and categorizes it into system software, which coordinates all the activities of the computer system, and application software, which runs via the help of system software, allowing the user interact with the system to achieve a specific purpose. 

An operating system is a system software that provides an interface between the user and the system hardware (Gupta et al., 2020). Linux OS or macOS may be appropriate for an IT role due to their UNIX-based shells, while Windows OS is ideal for a human resource role as its learning curve is not as steep as the other two.

Application software can be general purpose or tailor-made according to the needs and wants of the client of a development firm (Gupta et al., 2020). Tailor-made software, such as an administrative dashboard, would be instrumental to an operations manager for oversight. 

General purpose software like word processors, spreadsheet and database software aid in letter writing, sales report generation and inventory management respectively. Roles in administration, sales, and budget and expense tracking may require these for regular tasks.

Role of von Neumann Architecture in decision making

The von Neumann architecture, so named after its designer, Johann von Neumann, was the first formal description of a single-memory stored-program computer (Bawden et al., 2022). 
 
The model proposes three components. The central processing unit (CPU) contains a datapath and a control finite state machine. The CPU is connected to a read-write memory, referred to as the main memory, with which it interacts by sending an address to access a value or an instruction stored therein. The input/output devices enable data storage access and communication with the outside world (MIT OpenCourseWare, 2019).

MIT OpenCourseWare (2019) outlines the instruction execution loop in von Neumann machines as follows. The CPU fetches the instruction from the address in main memory specified by the program counter (PC).  The instruction fields are converted to appropriate signals for the datapath, selecting the source operands from the specified registers. The arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) is directed to perform the operation and the result is stored in the destination register. Finally, the PC's value is updated to the address of the next instruction.

The CPU, via interconnected circuits known as a bus, accesses data or instructions from the main memory, but not both at the same time. This results in the data transfer rate being much lower that the actual capacity of CPU or the memory (Bawden et al., 2022; MIT OpenCourseWare, 2019; Rao, 2014). This affects performance when handling large data sets or graphics-intensive tasks. 

For a small business, this understanding guides decisions such as selecting systems with multi-core processors, larger cache memory, or dedicated GPUs to reduce bottlenecks and improve responsiveness. For example, a marketing team might require high-performance machines with parallel processing capabilities, whereas administrative staff could work efficiently with simpler systems.
