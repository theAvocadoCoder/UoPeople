### Grade Breakdown

| Metric                            | Points | Comment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Q1. Storage Needs Analysis        | 25     | The paper covers key aspects of storage, explaining HDDs, SSDs, USBs, and cloud storage, while clearly tying them to persistence and retrieval. However, it could go deeper into the differences between structured and unstructured data in an e-commerce context, and provide more concrete growth-related examples.                |
| Q2. Software Selection            | 25     | Identifies system software (operating systems), application software (databases, e-commerce platforms), and embedded software (POS systems). The explanation is solid, but the discussion would benefit from more detail on specific e-commerce platforms and database choices, and how these integrate together.                     |
| Q3. Challenges and Considerations | 18     | Lists scalability, security, compliance, cost, training, and reliability. These are appropriate, but the section reads more like a bulleted overview rather than a developed analysis with examples. More elaboration on risks (e.g., downtime during traffic spikes, regulatory consequences of non-compliance) would strengthen it. |
| Clarity & Mechanics               | 8      | The writing is clear, logical, and well-organized. Minor stylistic issues, but overall very readable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Sources & Evidence                | 12     | Uses Gupta & Goyal (course text) and one external source (YouTube video on embedded software). While citations are present, stronger use of academic or professional sources (e.g., journal articles or authoritative industry resources) would strengthen credibility.                                                               |

| Points Received | Max Points |

### Feedback Comments
> Kelechi, you provided a clear and structured response that covered the main aspects of storage, software, and potential challenges. I especially appreciated how you distinguished between system, application, and embedded software and tied each to practical business uses. Your treatment of storage devices was also strong, with good attention to persistence and retrieval. For improvement, I recommend expanding your discussion with more detailed examples of how e-commerce businesses face these challenges in practice, especially in scalability and compliance. Also, try to rely more on academic and professional references beyond the course text and general media sources. This will make your analysis stronger and more credible. Overall, a solid and well-structured submission.
