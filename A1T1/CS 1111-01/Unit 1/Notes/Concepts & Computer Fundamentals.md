## Introduction
There are 4 types of data processing:
- Calculation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- Comparison: >, >=, < <=, <>
- Decision Making: based on a condition
- Logical Branching: based on decision made, jumping from one part of the compiler program to another.

The computer system performs 4 tasks for the user:
1. Accepts data
2. Stores data 
3. Does processing
4. Gives output/result to user

A computer system can also be called an information processing system

## Computer Classification
### On Purpose Basis
- General Purpose Computers
- Special Purpose Computers
### On Technology Basis
- Analog computers
- Digital computers
- Hybrid computers
### On the Basis of Memory Size & Capacity
- Microcomputers
- Minicomputers
- Mainframe
- Supercomputers (based on the principle of parallel processing which is known as a "Non_von Neumann Design)
### On the Basis of the Generations of  a Computer
- ==1st Gen (1940-56) ==: Used the thermionic valve/vacuum tube. Consumed a lot of electricity, generated too much heat.
- ==2nd Gen (1956-63)==: Used transistor technology. Assembly language replaced binary language.
- ==3rd Gen (1964-71)==: Used integrated circuit chip. Punched cards were replaced by keyboards.
- ==4th Gen (1971-present)==: Uses large scale integration & VLSI. Thousands of integrated circuits can now be built onto a single silicone chip.
- ==5th Gen (AI)==: Uses Ultra large-scale integration.

### Memory

**BIOS** (Basic Input-Output System) is a part of the operating system stored in the ROM.
#### Types of ROM (Read Only Memory)
- ==PROM== (Programmable ROM)
- ==EPROM== (Erasable Programmable ROM): Can be written to and erased and written to again. Requires exposing the device to UV rays and it must be removed from the computer system during this process.
- ==EEPROM== (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM): Can be written to and erased and written to again. Does not require ejection as erasure is achieved through electronic pulses.
#### Types of RAM (Random Access Memory)
- ==DRAM== (Dynamic RAM)
- ==SRAM== (Static RAM)
- ==EDO RAM== (Extended Data-Out RAM)
- ==SDRAM== (Synchronous Dynamic RAM)
- ==RDRAM== (Rambus Dynamic RAM)
### Storage
Hard disks were first introduced in 1956 for the purpose of bulk data storage.
