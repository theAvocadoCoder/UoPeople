The most widely used code for bit strings is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) by the American National Standards Institute. It is a 7-bit code but limited to the Latin alphabet, Arabic numerals and a few other symbols.

ASCII has been supplanted by Unicode which handles a wider variety of symbols by using a 32-bit code.

Alan Turing's (1912-54) theoretical studies, specifically his concept of the Turing Machine, developed in the 1930's, showed that a single machine limited to a few simple operations (read, write, delete, compare) could undertake any task if appropriately programmed. This demonstration gave rise to (/inspired) the idea that a general-purpose computing machine could be possible.

Johann von Neumann (1903-57) set out the basic architecture for a practical digital computer in his design which gave the first formal description of a single-memory stored-program computer.

A von Neumann machine loads and runs programs as necessary to accomplish very different tasks.

Fetch-execute cycle is the sequence in which the processor carries out a basic set of arithmetic and logic operations with instructions and data pulled in from the memory.

Data bus (or address bus or just 'bus') is a set of circuits that link together input and output devices.

Input devices are of 3 categories:
- user interactivity, e.g. keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, etc.
- external digital source data input, e.g. pen drive, network ports, etc.
- paper to digital, e.g. scanner

Output devices are also of 3 categories:
- display screens
- data sticks, network circuits and ports
- printers (laser or inkjet) 

Mixed reality is the combination of real and virtual environments, a spectrum with augmented reality at one end and virtual reality at the other.
