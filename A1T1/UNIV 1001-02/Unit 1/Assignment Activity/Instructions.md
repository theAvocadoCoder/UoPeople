#### Assignment:

Based on the readings of this unit and your understanding, answer the following questions:

1. You will transition during your educational journey, adjusting your views and practices. The unit reading from Baldwin et al. (2020, Section 1.2) states “college not only will expand your mind, but it may also make you a little uncomfortable, challenge your identity, and at times, make you doubt your abilities”. Discussions in UoPeople courses have similarities to your prior experiences when interacting in online social communities. Some aspects of your prior experiences will help you engage in UoPeople learning community, while others may require adjustment.
    
    - Which adjustment listed in Baldwin et al. (2020) applies to your transition from informal interaction in social forums to our learning community? How will you adapt?
    
  
2. Before responding to this question, read [Netiquette: Ground Rules for Online Discussion](https://tilt.colostate.edu/Netiquette-Ground-Rules-For-Online-Discussions/) and reflect on your experience in online discussion.
    
    Describe the difference between discussion in a social community and our online learning community. Include two rules of netiquette in your response (one from the list below and one of your choices from the reading) and describe why they are relevant.
    
    Rules of netiquette list:
    
    - Respect Diversity
    - Participate
    - Proper Writing Style
    - Cite Your Sources
