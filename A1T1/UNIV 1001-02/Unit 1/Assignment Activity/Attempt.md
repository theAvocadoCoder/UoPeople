**Assignment Response**

1. The most significant adjustment I am already facing is an academic adjustment (Baldwin et al., 2020, Section 1.2). Having spent the past half decade outside of an academic or corporate environment, reintegrating with formal language is proving to be a difficult experience. In this same vein, allocating time for studying and utilizing effective studying techniques are areas I am discovering my inadequacy in.
    

Adaptation for me involves reading the posts of my peers and instructors to get more comfortable with the academic tone, as well as relying on grammar correcting software to proofread my writing. I am also employing a task manager to properly schedule time for studying so as to not fall further behind.

2. Discussions in a social community are informal, opinion-driven, and feature casual writing. On the other hand, UoPeople discussions are academic, evidence-based, and possess a clear structure.Â 
    

Respect for diversity prevents a monopoly in the free market of ideas. It allows for the rubbing of minds of various cultures, which is crucial for broadening perspective and gaining deeper insights.

Helping others (The Institute for Learning and Teaching, 2022) fosters collaboration and a sense of camaraderie. It builds and strengthens connections between academic peers, which enhances the collective progress of humanity.
