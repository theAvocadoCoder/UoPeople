The discussion question aims to cultivate a holistic understanding of network fundamentals. You will learn to distinguish between various types of networks (e.g., LANs, WANs) and comprehend the advantages and limitations of each. You will be able to discuss common network topologies (e.g., star, mesh) and evaluate their applicability to different business scenarios. You will grasp the functions of essential connecting devices like routers, switches, and hubs within a network. 

**Imagine you have been hired as a consultant by a small business that is planning to set up its first computer network. The business owner is not familiar with networking concepts and has asked you to provide a comprehensive overview of network fundamentals and Internet basics. Your task is to engage in a discussion with the owner, addressing their questions and concerns.**  

1. Explain the different types of networks and common network topologies. Discuss which type might be most suitable for a small business and why? 

2. What is the role of connecting devices in a network, including routers, switches, and hubs. Elaborate how these devices facilitate communication within a network.  

3. Explore the transmission modes and discuss scenarios where each transmission mode is most appropriate.
