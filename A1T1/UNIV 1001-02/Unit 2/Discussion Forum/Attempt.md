**Question 1**  
  
The Code of Academic Integrity outlines standards of academic integrity that the university expects all scholars to maintain in their academic pursuits; emphasizes its intolerance of plagiarism and other practices that invalidate the content of academic work; and states the conditions under which students may publicly share their academic work.  
  
The Non-Retaliation policy expresses the University's commitment to operating with integrity and maintaining harassment- and discrimination-free environments. The policy protects individuals who may be targeted with punitive measures on account of their participation in ensuring compliance with university policy.  
  
According to the University of the People's Code of Academic Integrity (UoPeople, n.d., para. 8), plagiarism is "the intentional or unintentional representation of another's words or ideas as one's own in any academic exercise." Before engaging with the reading materials of this unit, I had assumed that plagiarism always involved using another's exact words without proper attribution. This definition, however, reveals that plagiarism is not limited to verbatim adoptions; citing another's perspective on a complex concept without proper citation would constitute plagiarism.  
  
**Question 2**  
  
The Program advisor acts as the individual point of contact for the student, offering guidance and support (UoPeople, n.d.), while university policies serve as guidelines that model student behaviour. Both serve the purpose of ensuring the security and efficacy of the learning environment, thereby aiding the student's navigation of their academic journey at UoPeople.  
  
**Question 3**

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools, while revolutionary, come with significant drawbacks, especially when used in an academic context. These drawbacks could include fabricating citations to defend its statements or simply bias contained in its training data set, which is included in the output (The Georgetown University Library, 2025).  
  
Because GAI models are trained on the works of real authors, including these tools' generated responses in academic work could amount to plagiarism, especially since they may not cite the original work from which they were drawn. Critical evaluation of these generated texts is required to ensure compliance with the provision on plagiarism in the UoPeople's Code of Academic Integrity. The policy also prohibits the sharing of academic work, including uploading to a GAI tool with a lax privacy policy.  
  
**Question 4**

- I have answered all the questions according to the criteria in the rubric.  
- I have referenced resources to support my ideas.  
- I have stayed within the word count (not including the reference list).
