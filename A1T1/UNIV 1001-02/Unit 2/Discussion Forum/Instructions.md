#### Assignment:
---

This week’s discussion is about how UoPeople policies apply in our learning community and the role of rubrics in UoPeople assignments. Based on the readings of this unit and your own understanding, answer the following discussion questions:

1. University policies establish standards, expectations, and guidelines that apply to all students. These policies can be found on UoPeople website and in the UoPeople catalog. One of the policies we have is the Code of Academic Integrity that addresses the consequences of plagiarism, a concept that can vary based on cultural differences and prior experiences.

	In the unit reading, Baldwin et al. (2020, Unit 7.6 text) state, “you are the best judge of how well you know a topic or a skill. In college especially, thinking about your thinking is crucial so you know what you don’t know and how to fix this problem, i.e., what you need to study”. Thinking and making relevant connections while reading is necessary to promote understanding.
	- Summarize the Code of Academic Integrity and one other policy you find in the catalog or website. Explain their implications for students.
	- Clarify the meaning of plagiarism when reviewing the Code of Academic Integrity. Discuss how the definition differs from your prior understanding of it.
	
2. Advisement Resources include information to help you navigate your educational journey and achieve your goals. Reflect on your experience using the resources to enroll. Revisit UoPeople Advisement Resources and explain its connections to UoPeople policies.

3. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved and is now embedded in many aspects of life, including academic settings. Interacting with AI comes with risks, such as misinformation, bias, and plagiarism (The Georgetown University Library, 2025). Based on these risks, explain how UoPeople policies influence the use of AI in your studies.

4. In this unit you have learned how to use a rubric. The rubric is a checklist to ensure you meet the assignment requirements. Reflect on your initial discussion response and compare to the rubric to self-check for completeness. Do you believe you have:

	- Answered all the questions according to the criteria in the rubric.
	- Referenced resources to support your ideas.
	- Stayed within the word count.
