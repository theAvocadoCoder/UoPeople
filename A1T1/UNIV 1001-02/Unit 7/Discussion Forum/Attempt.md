Q1. Behaviors That Help or Hinder Time Management

Two behaviours that have helped manage my time are using the Pomodoro technique and listening to readings via text-to-speech software.

The Pomodoro technique allows me to break tasks into short, timed intervals while supporting breaks in between. This lets me sustain focus and reduce burnout. College Success recommends this strategy for maintaining concentration, noting that short breaks can actually strengthen long-term focus (Baldwin et al., 2020).

I also use text-to-speech browser extensions to listen to my reading materials. This helps me process information more quickly and efficiently, especially because I am prone to mental fatigue. This approach aligns with the idea of adapting study strategies to personal learning preferences, suggested by Baldwin et al. (2020).

My biggest hindrance, however, is perfectionism. When I feel tired or uncertain about my understanding of a topic, I tend to postpone starting the assignment for fear of doing it wrong. This procrastination becomes a cycle: I put off the task, then rush through it at the last minute, leaving myself stressed and exhausted. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC, 2025) notes that emotional distractions such as anxiety can be as disruptive as digital ones, often resulting in lost time and reduced performance. Recognizing this pattern helps me understand how my mindset can be a significant barrier to managing my time.


Q2. Time Management and Prioritization

The reading from this week has illuminated my habit of deciding daily priorities based on my emotional reactions, rather than a rational assessment of urgency and importance. Both external and internal factors such as deadlines, personal energy levels, and conflicting commitments influence my prioritization.

In the future, I plan to prioritize my daily tasks using the Eisenhower Matrix, as recommended in _College Success_ (Baldwin et al., 2020). This method will help me distinguish between what is urgent and important, allowing me to focus on high-priority work while scheduling or delegating less critical tasks. 

I will also adopt the SMART goals framework (Ask Doctor Jodi, 2023; Baldwin et al., 2020), setting clear, specific, and time-bound objectives to ensure I can track progress more effectively.


Q3. Application: Improving Efficiency and Self-Motivation

These time management strategies will help me become more efficient by reducing wasted effort and creating a realistic sense of structure. 

Using the Eisenhower Matrix will ensure that I focus my energy on meaningful work rather than reactive or low-value tasks. Setting SMART goals will give me a sense of progress, which will build confidence and self-motivation (Ask Doctor Jodi, 2023).

As Baldwin et al. (2020) explain, consistent planning and self-regulation promote autonomy and self-motivation, which are key factors for long-term academic success. Moreover, _Rise With Odn_ (2025) emphasizes that ambition without structure can lead to stagnation, and that disciplined consistency is what truly drives personal growth.
