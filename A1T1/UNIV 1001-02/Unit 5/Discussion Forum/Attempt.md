#### Part 1 A – Values

My top five values are curiosity, freedom, stability, community, and growth.

As a curious person, continuous learning is the hallmark of my existence. This is why I chose my course of study, Computer Science, which has been an interest of mine for some years now. 

While studying for my first degree, the choice was not mine. This made the experience painful at times, and ultimately dangerous for my well-being. I am pursuing this second degree, knowing I am free to follow my passions and interests. 

I can do my best in my studies, acquire valuable knowledge and graduate with good grades. This increases my chances of gaining employment with suitable compensation, and achieving my goal of financial stability. The decision to continue my education is a step on my path to ensuring stability in my life, and the lives of my loved ones.

This academic setting will enable me to form connections with peers who have similar interests to mine, build life-long friendships with people who broaden my perspectives, and engage in insightful interactions. 

Already, I am receiving feedback from my instructors. This has allowed me to reflect and improve my abilities. The development I was sure to undergo in university was a strong, convincing determinant.

#### Part 1 B – Career Options

A report by the American Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS, 2025) surprised me. They reported that the median annual wage for occupations in computer and information technology as of May 2024 was $104,990. This surprised me as it is far greater than the median for all occupations which, at that time, sat at $49,500.

Two potential career options that interest me are Cloud Engineering and Software Development. These roles interest me because I find the software development lifecycle to be a creative process. Both career options deal with software development which allows me to express myself creatively within a clearly defined scope, while solving real world problems.

#### Part 2 – Meaningful Discussion

One of the "Cs" mentioned in Elsey's (2023) TED presentation stands for "constructive." This guideline implies that when giving feedback, we should be intentional about the words we choose. It also implies that our feedback should be positive and should highlight what can be done better, rather than simply stating that something is bad.

When giving feedback to my peers, I will choose my words carefully so that my responses validate and inspire reflection. I will not be unduly critical of a response that could be improved. Instead, I will highlight the strengths of the submission, and offer insights into how improvements may be achieved.
