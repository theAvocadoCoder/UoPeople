**Part 1**

I selected the concept mapping strategy because it was the least familiar strategy to me. In the past, I have used the other note taking strategies in one capacity or the other. I surmised that selecting a novel strategy is the best way to engage with this exercise.

I was not completely unfamiliar with concept mapping, but I had never tried it. In terms of comfort, it pales in comparison to my current note-taking method. I understand that this is to be expected of new activities. 

It takes much less time, and does not require me to divert my attention away from the study material for too long. It does requires more creativity in note-taking than I am used to. I believe my opinions are still premature and will develop the more I use the strategy.

My notes are attached.

**Part 2**

I consider the source to be credible for a number of reasons. The most prominent being that TED is an organization with a reputation for disseminating accurate information. The website is managed by TED. When evaluating a website, this is one of the important things to note (Excelsior OWL, n.d., Question 7). 

Furthermore, the author's information is provided in the source. Looking him up reveals that he is a doctorate student at Rutgers University's Communication department on the Media Studies track. His contact information is also available. Excelsior OWL (n.d., Questions 3, 5) outlines the author's identity and contact information as important questions to ask when evaluating a website. 

University of the People (n.d.) also says to confirm authorship and authority. I believe a doctorate student of communication may speak authoritatively on what constitutes misinformation.

Information literacy allows you properly decipher relevant and accurate information. Without it, we would make poorly-informed choices and often fall for mis- and disinformation. In academic research, information literacy helps us maintain the integrity of our work, by ensuring only credible sources are consulted.
