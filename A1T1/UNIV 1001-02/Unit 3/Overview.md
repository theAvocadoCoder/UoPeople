### Introduction
Welcome to week 3!

You have located many resources, navigated the course room, and successfully contributed to developing our learning community. Take a moment to acknowledge the success you have had. Now that you are comfortable navigating the classroom and interacting with peers, you will use the resources to complete assignments.

You may have noticed that many assignments will require you to write. Writing is not just important for completing your degree, but it is also a way to organize your thoughts and express ideas clearly. Strong writing skills will help you in life, whether you are presenting at work or explaining a concept to someone.

This week, you will outline an essay. A well-structured outline helps you create logical flow. To support your outline, you will revisit the Library and LRC. There is an Academic Writing section in the LRC which you can use to support the development of your writing skills and APA formatting. The resources you identify will be used to begin developing the essay outline. The initial writing process of researching and outlining will be completed during Week 3.

In addition to that, you will also reflect on the importance of giving credits and how to use artificial intelligence ethically for school. Lastly, grades and comments have been posted for Week 1. The grade and comments are useful information to promote your learning and identify areas of opportunity to learn. You will review Week 1 grades and comments to improve your academic work.
