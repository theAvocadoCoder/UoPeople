### Stress Management and Test Anxiety

**Part 1: Stress Management**

When left unmanaged, stress can affect both physical and mental health. Baldwin et al. (2020) explain that stress triggers the body's natural "fight or flight" response, which can be very helpful in emergencies but when prolonged, the opposite is the case. This constant state of alertness builds up overtime till it leads to burnout, or poor focus, or emotional fatigue. I often feel stressed out, and this tends to spill into all areas of my life, personal and professional. I make poor decisions, I procrastinate important tasks, I get irritable. High stress prevents me from being the best version of myself.

In the past, one practice that has helped me manage stress is creating visual art, specifically Zentangle(R) art which involves drawing structured patterns (Zentangle, n.d.). The Zentangle(R) Method was created by Rick Roberts and Maria Thomas. The method encourages gratitude and appreciation, allows me to be grounded in my current reality, and serves as an outlet for creating expression; all while inspiring a state of zen while I draw. This aligns with Baldwin et al.'s (2020) suggestion to externalize emotions so as to reduce internal pressure. Engaging in Zentangle(R) art allows me to entre a flow state, thus releasing much of the tension stored in my body. More information about this method can be found at zentangle.com.

A new practice I plan to adopt in my stress toolkit is mindful meditation combined with progressive muscle relaxation. While not completely new concepts to me, I have not practiced either consciously for a few years and I am aware that they are effective at helping me relax and be present. This approach involves tensing and relaxing each muscle group while gently guiding my mind to each sensation. This helps reduce physiological symptoms of stress (Mayo Clinic, 2024). I will determine its effectiveness by tracking my heart rate and mood before and after sessions for two weeks. If I notice improvements in calmness and focus, I will make it a frequent practice, especially before high-pressure events like exams.

**Part 2: Test Anxiety**

To manage anxiety while preparing for final exams, I will use spaced practice and self-testing. Baldwin et al. (2020) emphasize preparation as the foundation for confidence; studying in manageable chunks aids memory and reduces the last-minute pressure, and by extension, anxiety. Self-testing also mimics exam conditions, which makes the actual exam less intimidating.

On exam day, I will utilize positive visualization and structured breathing to stay grounded. Visualizing a test experience that reflects my preparedness will deal with the negative thoughts (College of Western Idaho, 2023), while controlled breathing slows the heart rate and improves concentration. I also plan to set aside enough time for the exam, prepare a clean, disruption-free environment, and quickly scan the questions to allocate time efficiently. These strategies are consistent with Baldwin et al.â€™s (2020) recommendations for effective exam performance.

I chose these techniques because they combine cognitive and physiological approaches. I can prepare my mental state, be present in my body, be physically comfortable in the environment I've chosen and also manage my time. All these will allow me stay confident and relaxed, improving my chances of giving the exams my best effort.
